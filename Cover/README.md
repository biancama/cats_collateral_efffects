# Cover

This is the cover for the book. It is a separate latex file to the rest of the book. It can be merged with the actual book PDF if needed by running `sh scripts/build-book.sh` from the project root. For a physical copy it can be uploaded as the suggest cover art at places like amazon if a physical copy is to be printed.

## Color

The color is defined by the `covercolor` variable in `cover.tex`. It is currently set to `067BB0` but can be changed to any hex color.

## Image

The image used is `image.png` variable in `cover.tex`. You can replace this with any image you want. You may need to modify the width of the image in the `cover.tex` file to get it to fit correctly.
